## 📌 Project Overview

**MindSync** is a human-centered digital wellbeing application developed by **me and my teammates** as part of a **Human Computer Interaction (HCI)** project. The project focuses on combining **sleep tracking**, **emotional reflection**, and **community storytelling** to support mental health, self-awareness, and personal growth.

Rather than focusing only on raw sleep data, MindSync emphasizes how users **feel after sleep**, how they **reflect on emotions**, and how shared stories help build empathy and meaningful connection.

The application was designed as a **low to high-fidelity interactive prototype** using **Figma**, with simulated data to evaluate usability, interaction flow, and emotional design in an academic HCI context.




## 🎯 Problem Statement & HCI Focus

Many young adults face irregular sleep, stress, emotional overload, and a lack of safe spaces for reflection and expression. Valuable personal experiences often go unshared due to fear of judgment and limited supportive platforms.

**MindSync** addresses this by offering a calm and private digital space for sleep awareness, emotional reflection, and anonymous or public storytelling. The project applies core **HCI principles** such as emotional design, minimal cognitive load, accessibility, strong privacy control, and supportive feedback. Its focus is on **digital wellbeing through thoughtful interaction design**, not medical diagnosis.

## 📄 Scope, Ethics & Design Approach

This project is developed as a **high-fidelity HCI prototype** focused on usability, interaction flow, and emotional design. It does not include real sensor integration, backend services, or machine learning models, and all system data is simulated. User privacy and emotional safety are prioritized through anonymous sharing, non-judgmental feedback, and the absence of forced notifications. The project scope is intentionally limited to design exploration and evaluation, with user research conducted on a small sample size.

The design follows a **calm and accessible UI/UX style**, using a blue, green, and white color palette with soft gradients and minimal card-based layouts. Emotion-focused icons, clear visual hierarchy, and accessibility-friendly spacing are used to reduce cognitive load and create a supportive user experience suited for wellbeing applications.

Academically, this repository documents the complete **HCI design process**, including low-fidelity sketching, user research and interviews, heuristic evaluation, high-fidelity prototyping, and interface evaluation. It also outlines future enhancement possibilities such as real sleep sensor integration, AI-based insights, sentiment analysis for reflections, and full mobile or web application development, serving as both a design archive and a foundation for future implementation.


## 📌 Repository Purpose
This repository documents:
- The project concept  
- UI/UX design decisions  
- Interaction flows  
- Project Report & Presentation Slides


## ✨ Closing Note
**MindSync** demonstrates how thoughtful, human-centered design can support wellbeing by combining **sleep awareness**, **emotional reflection**, and **shared human experiences** in a calm digital space.
